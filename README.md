### 🛠️ Presentation Focus:  
> **“Driver Development in Embedded Linux & Android – A Career Path for Engineers”**

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**  
**Title:**  
🚀 *Driver Development in Embedded Linux & Android*  
**Subtitle:**  
Career Opportunities & Roadmap for Engineering Students – 2025  

---

### **Slide 2: What Are Device Drivers?**  
**Content:**  
- Interface between **hardware** and **OS kernel**  
- Written mostly in **C** for Linux kernel  
- Needed for every hardware: sensors, displays, touch, Bluetooth, etc.  
- Two key platforms: **Embedded Linux** and **Android**

---

### **Slide 3: Types of Drivers**  
| Platform          | Types of Drivers              |  
|------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Embedded Linux   | I2C, SPI, GPIO, USB, PCIe, etc. |  
| Android          | HAL Drivers, Binder-based IPC |  
| Common Layer     | Linux Kernel Driver            |

[ System Call Interface ]  
     ↓  
[ Kernel Driver (C) ]  
     ↓  
[ Hardware Registers / Bus ]
```

### **Slide 5: Android Driver Stack**
**Visual Diagram**:
```
[ Android App (Java/Kotlin) ]  
     ↓  
[ Android Framework ]  
     ↓  
[ HAL (C/C++) via HIDL / AIDL ]  
     ↓  
[ Linux Kernel Driver (C) ]  
     ↓  
[ Hardware ]
```

📌 *Android HAL communicates with Linux drivers under the hood.*

### **Slide 6: Skills Needed for Driver Development**  
**Common Skills:**  
- C Programming, Pointers, Memory Management  
- Linux Kernel Internals  
- OS Concepts (Processes, Interrupts, Scheduling)  

**Embedded Linux Specific:**  
- Platform Drivers, Character Device Drivers  
- GPIO, I2C, SPI, DMA  
- U-Boot / DTS (Device Tree)

**Android Specific:**  
- HAL Development (HIDL/AIDL)  
- JNI for Native Code Integration  
- Debugging with ADB, logcat  
- AOSP build system

---

### **Slide 7: Tools You’ll Use**  
- `GCC`, `make`, `insmod`, `rmmod`, `dmesg`  
- `ADB`, `fastboot`, `strace`, `logcat`  
- `GDB`, Oscilloscopes, Logic Analyzers  
- Git, Gerrit (for AOSP contributions)

---

### **Slide 8: Real-World Examples**  
| Use Case                | Driver Stack                                 |  
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| Touchscreen on Linux    | I2C → Input Driver → evdev → User Space      |  
| Bluetooth in Android    | UART → Kernel Driver → HAL → Framework       |  
| Camera in Android Auto  | V4L2 Driver → HAL3 → CameraService → App     |

---

### **Slide 9: Job Roles & Companies**  
**Roles:**  
- Embedded Linux Driver Developer  
- Android HAL Engineer  
- BSP Developer  
- Automotive Android Engineer  

**Companies:**  
- Qualcomm, Samsung, Google, Tata Elxsi, KPIT, Mahindra Electric, Bosch  

---

### **Slide 10: Getting Started – Your Roadmap**  
1. Learn **C** deeply  
2. Master **Linux Kernel Module programming**  
3. Work on Raspberry Pi or Luckfox board  
4. Build simple drivers: LED, ADC, I2C  
5. Study **AOSP**, HAL, and Binder communication  
6. Contribute to open-source driver projects

---

### **Slide 11: Bonus – Boards to Practice On**  
- 📦 Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone
